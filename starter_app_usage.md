# Using the starter apps
{: #using_starter_apps}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} provides starter apps, called boilerplates. Boilerplates are templates that include one application, its associated runtime environment, and predefined services for a particular domain. Follow these steps to select a boilerplate and begin working.
{:shortdesc}

## Choosing a boilerplate

1. From the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/),
navigate to the Starter Kits section.
2. Click the boilerplate you want to use.
3. Enter a name for your app, modify the host name if required, and click **Create**. Your app begins staging, and the Getting started tutorial for your app on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Dashboard displays.
4. Follow the steps in the tutorial to:  
  * Download the software you need to build your app.
  * Download the sample app.
  * Deploy the sample app.

The directory containing the sample app you downloaded contains a `README` file. Refer to the `README` for a description of the files in the sample app package. You can make changes to the code in the sample application, deploy the application again, and then see the changes in your running app.
