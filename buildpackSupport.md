# Buildpack support statement
{: #buildpack_support_statement}


## Built-in IBM buildpacks
{: #built-in_ibm_buildpacks}

For [Liberty for Java](/docs/runtimes/liberty/index.html), [SDK for Node.js](/docs/runtimes/nodejs/index.html), and [ASP.NET Core](/docs/runtimes/dotnet/index.html), IBM will support two versions (n & n - 1), for example, IBM Liberty Buildpack v3.12 & IBM Liberty Buildpack v3.11. Each buildpack will provide and support one or more major versions of its corresponding runtime as appropriate. Buildpacks will typically be refreshed once a month with the latest minor version of the runtime that is available.

For the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Runtime for Swift](/docs/runtimes/swift/index.html), IBM provides support for the buildpack matching the latest version of Swift available at [Swift.org](http://swift.org). Updates to the buildpack are in sync with the latest available released version of Swift.

Problems and issues can be reported against any version of the built-in IBM Buildpack that is currently supported on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, but they will be verified against the latest version. If a defect is found, IBM will provide a fix in a future level of the runtime and corresponding buildpack. IBM will not provide fixes for earlier major and minor versions (N-1, n-1). IBM will not provide support for community runtimes even when using IBM buildpacks, for example, using Open JDK with the Liberty buildpack. These community runtimes follow the same support policy as the built-in community buildpacks, as described in the following section.

## Built-in community buildpacks
{: #built-in_community_buildpacks}

The following built-in Community Buildpacks are provided by the Cloud Foundry Community:

* [Java](/docs/runtimes/tomcat/index.html)
* [Node.js](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack)
* [PHP](/docs/runtimes/php/index.html)
* [Ruby](/docs/runtimes/ruby/index.html)
* [Python](/docs/runtimes/python/index.html)
* [Go](/docs/runtimes/go/index.html)

Updates to these buildpacks will be made when {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is upgraded to a new version of Cloud Foundry. Problems or issues with these runtimes on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} can be reported to IBM, and we will assist in determining if {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is the source of the problem. For issues that are related to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, IBM will provide a fix; however, for defects in the buildpack or runtime itself, IBM will assist in reporting them to the appropriate community. IBM will not provide fixes for these buildpacks and runtimes.

## External buildpacks
{: #external_buildpacks}

For external buildpacks, support will not be provided by IBM. You might need to contact the Cloud Foundry Community for support.

## Third-party services
{: #third-party}

The buildpacks enable you to use some non-IBM, third-party services, such as Dynatrace or New Relic, within your applications. IBM does not provide support for third-party services. For information about using third-party services in IBM Cloud, see _Cloud Service Use_ in the latest [IBM Cloud service description ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www-03.ibm.com/software/sla/sladb.nsf/sla/bm). Before you use a third-party service, consult the licensing information from the service provider.
